                    <p>Legally, all carriers must carry a minimum amount of insurance, known as carrier liability. However, carrier liability provides very limited coverage, and anything from natural disasters to vehicle accidents or even acts of war could damage your cargo. Therefore, shippers can request cargo insurance to protect their goods from loss, damage, or theft while in transit.</p>
